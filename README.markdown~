Nibble stand alone PHP classes and library's
============================================

Nibble stand alone's are simple PHP classes or library's (collection of classes) that 
make developing easier.  The current two stand alone's available are:

* Nibble forms:  An easy to use PHP form class that can produce forms/fields from one or 
  two arguments depending on the field type.  More arguments are available to allow
  customisation of the forms produced.  Documentation is on the Nibble development site
  [here](http://nibble-development.com/nibble-forms "Nibble forms documentation").
* Nibble flash messaging:  A simple flash messaging class that allows messages
  to be created in a controller and outputted to the user in a "growl" like format.
  Messages can be created for the view about to be rendered, or for the next view
  after that.  Documentation is on the Nibble development site
  [here](http://nibble-development.com/flash-messaging "Nibble flash messaging documentation").

Simple form example:

`$form = NibbleForm::getInstance('', 'Submit this form','post',true,'flash');

  $form->username = new Text('Please enter your username', true, 20, '/[a-zA-Z0-9]+/');

  $form->email = new Email('Please enter your email');

  $form->email->addConfirmation('Please confirm your email');

  $form->password = new Password('Please enter your password', 11, true, true, 12);

  $form->password->addConfirmation('Please confirm your password');
`

Simple flash example:

`$flash->flashMessage('Message content goes here, 5s lifetime','Message title goes here',5000);`
  
Hopefully one of these stand alones will make your day easier, both are served with the
